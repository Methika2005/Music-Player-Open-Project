## üí° DSA Concepts Used

| Feature                 | Data Structure / Concept                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Playlist storage        | **Circular Doubly Linked List** (CDLL) ‚Äì Each song is a node with `prev` and `next` pointers. Allows O(1) navigation in both directions and circular looping. |
| Adding / Deleting songs | CDLL insertion and deletion at head, tail, or middle.                                                                                                         |
| Next / Previous song    | Navigate the CDLL nodes forward or backward.                                                                                                                  |
| Shuffle                 | Convert CDLL nodes to an array, apply `random.shuffle()`, then rebuild CDLL.                                                                                  |
| Drag-and-Drop Reorder   | On drop, rearrange the `prev` and `next` pointers of CDLL nodes to reflect new order.                                                                         |

## üñº Diagram: Circular Doubly Linked List

```
       +---------+       +---------+       +---------+
       | Song 1  |<----->| Song 2  |<----->| Song 3  |
       +---------+       +---------+       +---------+
            ^                                |
            |                                v
            +--------------------------------+
           (tail.next points to head, making it circular)

```

* Each node (song) contains:

  * `title`
  * `artist`
  * `duration`
  * `prev` pointer
  * `next` pointer
* The **current song** pointer tracks which song is playing.
* Looping is handled using the CDLL's circular property.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

* Playlist order persists when using next/previous, shuffle, or manual reordering.
* Drag-and-drop reordering updates the linked list in memory.
* Circular doubly linked list ensures smooth looping and easy navigation.
* The app currently uses **dummy song data**; can be extended to real audio playback with HTML `<audio>` elements.
